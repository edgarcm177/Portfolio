    <h1>Web Development Intern (Brenau)</h1> 
        <p>My journey into coding and computer science began with my mentorship under Brenau University’s Web Editor, William Forrester. When I started in September 2023, I had a strong curiosity but little experience. Over time, this mentorship became the foundation of my technical skills and passion for software development.
        I began by learning the basics of HTML through hands-on exercises and lectures. From there, I progressed to CSS, understanding how styles shape user experience. The real challenge came with JavaScript, where I worked on if statements, loops, and functions—gaining insight into programming logic. To apply what I learned, I built this very website, reinforcing my understanding of front-end development.
        Before diving deep into web development, I also completed accessibility training, which taught me the importance of designing for inclusivity. This experience reshaped how I think about technology—not just as a tool, but as something that should be accessible to everyone.

    <h2>Retail Experience (Walmart)</h2>
        <p> At Walmart, I worked as an apparel associate, overseeing the fitting room’s daily operations and assisting customers. While this role wasn’t directly related to tech, it strengthened my problem-solving, teamwork, and adaptability. I took initiative to reorganize the department based on customer feedback, which helped increased our sales. My dedication and work ethic was even recognized with a 20% raise. This experience reinforced my ability to handle fast-paced environments—something that translates well into software development and research. 
        </p>

    <h2>Georgia Tech Research & Technical Projects</h2>
    <p>Currently, I’m a research assistant at Georgia Tech’s ACT Lab, where I work with a team to analyze autonomous vehicle (AV) crash reports. I started off in this role by cleaning up the dataset of any duplicates and handling missing values with python. Then I got the chance to apply and develop prompts for ChatGpt to turn our unstructured dataset to into a structured one. Then I got to apply text mining on our structured data to prepare it for our current step which is applying hierarchical clustering to identify edge cases in the data. This experience has helped sharpened my ability to work with large-scale data and collaborate on technical research.

    <br>Beyond my research, I also built a maze-navigating robot using the iRobot Create 3, which could autonomously detect obstacles and reroute itself. This project allowed me to apply object-oriented programming, asynchronous functions, and real-time decision-making algorithms to a real-world system.

    <h2>JavaScript</h2>
    <p>
        JavaScript is very interesting because when you get past the basics you get to actually see what your code is doing. For instance when I made a number guessing game. To achieve this I first made a button in my HTML document to call up a function I would make in JS and an input field to guess. Then in my JS file I made a function that used an already built in JS function to generate a number. Then with if statements I checked if the number in the input field was correct and if it was incorrect I checked if it was higher or lower. Depending on what statements it satisfied it would output text below the button that said either your correct, guess lower, or guess higher. Being able to see what my code did in real time was satisfying in the end because it gave me a sense of accomplishment after completing this difficult task.
