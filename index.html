<h1>About Me</h1> 
     <img src="images/Headshot1.JPG" alt="Headshot of Edgar Cruz" class="Headshot" >  

<p>Hey, I'm Edgar Cruz!

I'm currently a Computer Science student at Georgia Tech, passionate about software development and problem-solving. Originally from Gainesville, GA, I graduated as the valedictorian of East Hall High School.
<br><br>
At Georgia Tech, I've gotten the chance to be a Research Assistant in the ACT Lab. Where I've utilized LLM's to extract insights from datasets of autonomous vehicle crashes. Through this experience, I’ve honed my data analysis and machine learning skills while collaborating with a team to improve research methodologies.
Previously, I worked as a Web Development Intern at Brenau University, where I learned about web accessibility and contributed to improving the university’s online presence. I also spent two years at Walmart, where I enhanced my customer service and problem-solving abilities while improving store operations.
<br><br>
I’m always eager to learn new technologies and improve my skills, whether through research, personal projects, or leadership roles in my community.
I'm excited about the future and looking forward to opportunities where I can leverage my adaptability, work ethic, and passion for technology to make an impact!

<h2>My Interests Beyond Academics</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Thrifting: To me thrifting is a lot like gambling. Not every store I go to has something that catches my eye but when they do it makes it that much more rewarding. </li>
    <li>Working out: At first going to gym was a chore but over time as I started to see progress that changed. The thrill of being able to physically feel and see my changes makes up for the strain I put my body through.</li>
    <li>Video games: Ever since I was a little kid I was facsinated by videogames. Sneaking off late at night and hopping on my family computer to explore new worlds sparked something in me. All those late nights ignited my passion for computers and interest in computer science. </li>
    <li>Skateboarding: When I first started skateboarding I was shocked at just how much skill went into every single movement. The sheer amount of effort and practice that goes into every new trick is astonishing. Being able to be a part of that process though makes it work and makes landing that trick all the better. </li>
</ul>
