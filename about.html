    <h1>Mentorship</h1> 
        <p>My journey into coding and computer science began with my mentorship under Brenau University’s Web Editor, William Forrester. When I started in September, I had a strong curiosity but little experience. Over time, this mentorship became the foundation of my technical skills and passion for software development.
        I began by learning the basics of HTML through hands-on exercises and lectures. From there, I progressed to CSS, understanding how styles shape user experience. The real challenge came with JavaScript, where I worked on if statements, loops, and functions—gaining insight into programming logic. To apply what I learned, I built this very website, reinforcing my understanding of front-end development.
        Before diving deep into web development, I also completed accessibility training, which taught me the importance of designing for inclusivity. This experience reshaped how I think about technology—not just as a tool, but as something that should be accessible to everyone.

    <h2>HTML</h2>
        <p> HTML is an easy markup language to pick up that is used to make webpages online. To begin a HTML document all you need to do is start of with a doctype tag that tells a computer what type of document it is. Then you make the head tag followed by a closing head tag and then you make a body tag. In this body tag is where most of the content of the webpage you are making will go. Most body tags start with headers which desginate what the webpage is about. Then this is usually followed by text, buttons, input fields, or graphs depnding on the purpose of the webpage. Then after your done making content you simply close your body and then html tags. All of this serves as a base which then CSS builds upon.   
        </p>
    <br>
    <h2>CSS</h2>
    <p>CSS is what makes a website appealing and it can be done in various ways. For instance there is inline styling which is when you apply a style to a tag such as the color or font size by typing out the style attribute on the tag. Then theres internal where you make a style tag usually in the head and apply a style to the entire document. Then the most common form of CSS is external styling where you link a seprate document with all your CSS to your HTML document. This is to help seperate CSS from HTML and to have CSS apply to multiple webpages. With CSS there are so many things you can do like the formatting, styling, and even animations. Together with HTML they make up most of what we see on webpages.</p>
    <div class="ballbox">
        <div id="balls" class="Noball">
        </div>
    </div>
    <div style="margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;">
    <button id="Ani" class="focus">Start Animation</button>
    </div>
    <br>
    <h2>JavaScript</h2>
    <p>
        JavaScript is very interesting because when you get past the basics you get to actually see what your code is doing. For instance when I made a number guessing game. To achieve this I first made a button in my HTML document to call up a function I would make in JS and an input field to guess. Then in my JS file I made a function that used an already built in JS function to generate a number. Then with if statements I checked if the number in the input field was correct and if it was incorrect I checked if it was higher or lower. Depending on what statements it satisfied it would output text below the button that said either your correct, guess lower, or guess higher. Being able to see what my code did in real time was satisfying in the end because it gave me a sense of accomplishment after completing this difficult task.

    <select Name="Type" Id="Type" class="focus">
    <option value=20>D20</option>
    <option value=8>D8</option>
    <option value=6>D6</option>
    <option value=4>D4</option>
    </select>
    <button Id="Dice" class="focus">Roll a dice</button>
    <p Id="DiceOutcome"></p>
    <p Id="DiceTotal"></p>
    <h2>Accesibility Training</h2>
    <p> After now having gone through this training I now realize the importance of accessiblity. It serves to help all user webusers navigate the web easier without having to worrying about not getting the main message of content online. For instance, there are certain standards in place such as color contrast ratios, alternative text to images, and captions that make it easier to consume webpage content. These reasonable standard called WCAG make the World Web navigable by all people no matter what ever disability they may have.
